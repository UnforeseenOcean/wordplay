###To edit pages

Right now I'm using a templating system to serve content. Which is probably overkill, but it gives me a good chance to learn to use this stuff.

Pages are being served by Jade: http://jade-lang.com/
CSS by Nib & Stylus: http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/  http://visionmedia.github.io/nib/
